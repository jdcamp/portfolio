            <p>I had a job as an accountant for a few years but I did not have a passion for what I did. I decided that I needed to find something I would enjoy doing everyday (or most days). I always had an interest in computer science but never really took the time to learn any programming. Wanting to see if I would enjoy programming, I bought a book on java. The book was ok but it gave me enough to see that I would like this type of work. I wanted a more hands on approach to learning so I applied for Epicodus because of the amount of time students spend coding and learning.</p>
